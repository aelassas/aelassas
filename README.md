As the Chief Technology Officer at Teradev, I lead a team of software engineers and developers who create innovative and scalable solutions for digital media and e-commerce. With over 11 years of experience in software engineering, I have a strong background in web, mobile, and desktop development, as well as media asset management and digital asset management systems.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and frameworks, and applying them to solve complex and challenging problems. I work with Node, React, React Native, C#, and .NET, among other languages and tools. I also have experience in integrating and developing e-commerce platforms and cloud services. My mission is to deliver high quality software products that meet the needs and expectations of our clients and users.
