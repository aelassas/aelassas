I was born and raised in Casablanca, Morocco. I got a Master degree in Software Engineering in France, 2010. I worked as a Software Engineer in France for a couple of years. I went back to my hometown where I mainly work with Node, React, React Native, C# and .NET. I worked on Media Asset Management and Digital Asset Management systems, workflow engines, various applications for telecomunication companies, and full stack development.
