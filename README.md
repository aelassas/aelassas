As Chief Technology Officer at Teradev, I develop innovative and scalable solutions for digital media and e-commerce. With over 13 years of software engineering experience, I have a strong background in web, mobile and desktop development, as well as media asset management and digital asset management systems.

My strengths lie in the development of innovative solutions and the ability to adapt them to different sectors looking to streamline or automate their work processes or data management.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and frameworks and applying them to solve complex and challenging problems. I am proficient in working with Node.js, React, React Native, C# and .NET among other languages and tools. I also have experience integrating and developing e-commerce platforms and cloud services. My ultimate aim is to deliver high quality software products that cater to the requirements and expectations of our customers and users.

After obtaining my master's degree in software engineering in France in 2010, I worked in the suburbs of Paris as a software engineer for Mediatvcom, a company specializing in broadcasting, digital television, and new technologies. My job required me to lead a team of developers to create scalable turnkey solutions that met clients' particular needs.

After almost 8 years in France, I went back to my hometown and worked as a freelance software engineer for various companies, including Cristalys, a platform that employs machine learning models to assist asset managers, insurers, WMAs, and private bankers; Workiom, a cloud-based all-in-one business solution; Creative Labs, a digital marketing agency based in Casablanca; the Moroccan Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Environment; and other clients. I built various software products and applications for these clients, including native Node.js modules for Cristalys, a cross-platform workflow engine for Workiom, native Android apps, a set of tools that automate media fetching and distribution to YouTube, and other mobile and web-based tools and applications for other clients.
