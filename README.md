I was born and raised in Casablanca, Morocco. I was passioned about computing since an early age. I studied in France where I got a master degree in software engineering. I started programming with Basic on my TI-92, then OCaml in high school, then C, C++, Lisp and Java in engineering school, then C# and JavaScript at work. I worked as a full stack software engineer in France for few years. After almost 8 years in France, I went back to my hometown. I have a strong background on Media Asset Management and Digital Asset Management systems. I work with Node, React, React Native, C# and .NET. I also worked with other languages and other technologies. I like to discover new tools and frameworks. I can learn fast and produce high quality code before deadline.
