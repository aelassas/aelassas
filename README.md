##### ABOUT ME

I craft innovative and scalable solutions for digital media. My comprehensive experience spans web, mobile and desktop development, with particular focus on media and digital asset management systems.

My key strength lies in creating forward-thinking solutions that adapt across industries, enabling organizations to streamline and automate their workflows or data management processes.

##### MY OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS

I am the creator and maintainer of the following open-source projects:

* [Wexflow](https://github.com/aelassas/wexflow): .NET Workflow Engine and Automation Platform
* [BookCars](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars): Car Rental Platform with Mobile App
* [Movin' In](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin): Rental Property Management Platform with Mobile App
* [wexCommerce](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce): Sleek and Powerful ecommerce Platform
* [Wexstream](https://github.com/aelassas/wexstream): Video Conferencing Platform

By choosing my solutions, you can launch your own digital marketplace - whether it's an ecommerce website, car rental platform, or property rental system. Each solution comes with comprehensive documentation, Stripe and PayPal payment integration, and runs efficiently on just 1GB of RAM. Deploy your business for less than $5/month on cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets), making these platforms perfect for entrepreneurs seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions.

If these projects have been valuable to your work or research, please consider supporting their ongoing development and maintenance. You can contribute through [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/aelassas) (one-time or monthly), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/aelassaspp), or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/aelassas). Even a simple star on the GitHub repository helps spread the word and is greatly appreciated.
