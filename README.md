I craft innovative and scalable solutions for digital media, leveraging years of software engineering expertise. My comprehensive experience spans web, mobile and desktop development, with particular focus on media and digital asset management systems.

My key strength is creating forward-thinking solutions that adapt across industries, enabling organizations to streamline and automate their work process or data management.

##### OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS

I am the creator and maintainer of these open-source projects:

* [Wexflow](https://github.com/aelassas/wexflow): .NET Workflow Engine and Automation Platform
* [BookCars](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars): Car Rental Platform with Mobile App
* [Movin' In](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin): Rental Property Management Platform with Mobile App
* [wexCommerce](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce): Modern Single Vendor Marketplace
* [Wexstream](https://github.com/aelassas/wexstream): Video Conferencing Platform

By choosing my solutions, you can launch your own customizable digital marketplace - whether it's an eCommerce website, car rental platform, or property rental system - with the Docker-based setups provided. Each platform comes with demo links, comprehensive documentation, Stripe payment integration, and runs efficiently on just 1GB of RAM. Deploy your business for less than $5 monthly on cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets), making these platforms perfect for entrepreneurs seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions.

I invested significant time and effort into building these open-source projects to make them freely available to the community. If these projects have been helpful in your work, consider supporting their continued development and maintenance. You can contribute through [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/aelassas) (one-time or monthly), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/aelassaspp), or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/aelassas).
