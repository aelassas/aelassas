* [Light of truth (English - PDF)](https://2ly.link/27oLb): This book takes an in-depth look at different worldviews and perspectives, examining various theories about the origins of the universe and the nature of existence. Through logical reasoning and analysis, it offers a compelling perspective on creation and the purpose of life, encouraging readers to reflect on profound and essential questions. Like many, I was confronted with deep questions about existence and purpose, I sought answers through reason and study, determined to find a foundation that was both logical and undeniably true. Whether you approach this with doubt or conviction, I invite you to explore the arguments presented with an open mind. The truth is there for those willing to seek it.
* [Lumi√®res de v√©rit√©s (Fran√ßais - PDF)](https://2ly.link/27oLd): Ce livre explore diff√©rentes conceptions du monde en analysant diverses th√©ories sur l'origine de l'univers et la nature de l'existence. √Ä travers un raisonnement logique et une analyse rigoureuse, il propose une r√©flexion approfondie sur la cr√©ation et le but de la vie, incitant les lecteurs √† m√©diter sur des questions profondes et essentielles. Comme beaucoup, j'ai √©t√© confront√© √† des questions profondes sur l'existence et le sens de la vie. J'ai cherch√© des r√©ponses par la raison et l'√©tude, d√©termin√© √† trouver une base √† la fois logique et ind√©niablement vraie. Que vous abordiez ce sujet avec doute ou conviction, je vous invite √† explorer les arguments pr√©sent√©s avec un esprit ouvert. La v√©rit√© est accessible √† ceux qui sont pr√™ts √† la chercher.
