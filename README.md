As Chief Technology Officer at Teradev, I develop innovative and scalable solutions for digital media and e-commerce. With over 13 years of software engineering experience, I have a strong background in web, mobile and desktop development, as well as media asset management and digital asset management systems.

My strengths lie in the development of innovative solutions and the ability to adapt them to different sectors looking to streamline or automate their work processes or data management.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and frameworks and applying them to solve complex and challenging problems. I am proficient in working with Node.js, React, React Native, C# and .NET among other languages and tools. I also have experience integrating and developing e-commerce platforms and cloud services. My ultimate aim is to deliver high quality software products that cater to the requirements and expectations of our customers and users.
