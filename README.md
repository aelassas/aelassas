As Chief Technology Officer at Teradev, I develop innovative and scalable solutions for digital media. With over 13 years of software engineering experience, I have a strong background in web, mobile and desktop development, as well as media asset management and digital asset management systems.

My strength lies in the development of innovative solutions and the ability to adapt them to different industries looking to streamline or automate their work process or data management.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and frameworks and applying them to solve complex and challenging problems.

My ultimate aim is to deliver high-quality software products that meet the requirements and expectations of our customers.
